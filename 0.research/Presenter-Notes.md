## Context

## Projects
### The Language of New Media - Book

- Translated into 14 languages
#### Numerical representation
 - All new media objects can be described mathematically and can be manipulatedvia algorithms
 
#### modularity
- Functional programming
- HTML
- The opposite goal of an essay (to relate sentences to each other)

#### automation
- “human intentionality can be removed from the creative process, at least in part”

#### variability
- “a new media object is not something fixed once and for all, but something that canexist in different, potentially infinite versions” 
- Computer Games
 - Databases : “a variety of end-userobjects . . . can be generated,  either beforehand or on demand”

#### transcoding
- transcoding refers to the translation of a new media object from one format to another (for example, text to sound)

## Bonus Feature
### Do Songs Of The Summer All Sound The Same?
- Manovich early work focused on hisorial data (art images)
- Recongises the importance to look at both historical and current data to evaluate culture.


## Questions
### Do you think a hypothesis should be the starting point in a visualization?
- Do we need to understand the lanscape better before deciding on a question. Does this feed into Giorgia Lupi's approach of explorative visualizations?

### Do you see any issues in the use of social media to represent or evaluate culture (particularly in relation to Visual Earth)?
- Lack or uneven representation of social media use, especially when displayed on a map

### Many of Manovich's visualizations relate to out current use of social media. Do you think there are any other mass used electronic resources that could tell us about our current culture?
- wearables, IoT devices (Alexa, Siri)
