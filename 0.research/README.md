## Bio
- Born in Moscow
- Studied fine arts, architecture and computer programming.
- Moved to New York in 1981
- Receiving an M.A. in Visual Science and Cognitive Psychology from NYU in 1988
- Received a Ph.D. in Visual and Cultural Studies from University of Rochester in 1993

**Fun Fact** : In 1977 Manovich wrote his first computer program on paper before entering it into a computer. When he did it gave him an error because he used O instead of 0.

## Current Positions
- Author and editor of 13 books, including [The Language of New Media](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/language-new-media).
- Professor, Ph.D. Program in Computer Science, The Graduate Center, City University of New York (CUNY)
- Director, Cultural Analytics Lab (New York and La Jolla, California): [lab.culturalanalytics.info](http://lab.culturalanalytics.info)

## Context
### The Research Goal
“My advice is not to start with a research question, but to map what is where first. When we proceed like this, we get different results and end up with interpretations that vary from what we already know about our culture. This is our contribution to cultural development.” [Eurozine Interview](https://www.eurozine.com/articles/2015-10-30-manovich-en.html)

**Disclaimer** : Manovich's projects can only be fully appreciated & understood by considering the context in which they were created.
His prested work on his website ranges from 1994 - 2018. To put that into context thats the year [Pulp Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_in_film) came out!

### Moore's Law
Many of the projects were created at the cutting edge of technology for the time. In [2009](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtbzVuDqSas) Manovich was using a supercomputer to do what many of us have created using AWS Cloud 9 or our own personal computers. It is easy to forget how fast technology evolves so for each project i will try and contexualize each project in terms of date and technology. This table of examples of Moore's Law (stating that the number of transistors in a computer doubles about every two years) also helps to give a reference point.

## Projects
Most of Manovich's work surround the use of 'New Media' which he defines as having 5 elemements, **Numerical representation, modularity, automation, variability, and transcoding**.
