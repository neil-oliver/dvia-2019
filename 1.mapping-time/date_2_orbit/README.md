### Changes from initial Design
The implentation was true to the original sketch with a few additions
- A 3rd oribiting cirle is added that will rotate once in a year
- The new circle color will fade between different colors throughout the year to represent seasons.
- Each circle now orbits at faster speeds to accomodate the introduction of the 3rd orbiting circle.
