# Through Space and Time
## Design
Design adapted from the [Orbital Calendar](https://github.com/neil-oliver/dvia-2019/tree/master/1.mapping-time/date_2_orbit).

### Additions to Original Design
- Added sine wave balls to represent hour, minute, second.
- Added stars to present how many days through the year
- Added three progress bars on each orbit path to represent progress through the year, season, day and moon cycle.

### Changes
 - Removed the seasonal circle and replaced with seasonal progress bar.
 - Changed the blue circle to rotate once a year (from one a month) to make it the correct orbit for earth.
 - Changed the orbit of the grey cirlce to represent a full moon cycle.
 - Changed the yellow circle to an atom shape to try and distinguish it from objects that represent an element of time.
 - Removed / changed the alernating color background and settled on a night time theme.

## Final Product
Multiple ways to tell the time!
![](https://github.com/neil-oliver/dvia-2019/blob/master/1.mapping-time/final_through_space_and_time/through-space-and-time-final.png)

### Second
- The time to takes one red circle to bounce up and down

### Minute
- The time it takes for a red circle to move the width of the screen
- The number of red filled balls 
- The time the blue balls takes to bounce up and down

### Hour
- The number of blue filled balls on the screen
- The time taken for a blue ball to move the width of the screen

### Day / Night
- Blue 'planet' fades between two shades of blue

### Day
- Green progress stroke around the blue planet

### Moon
- Grey planet orbits around blue planet
- Grey progress stroke (follows path of orbit)

### Season 
- Color fade between seasonal colors on blue planet orbit path

### Year
- Blue planet orbits around the sun
- Seasonal progress stroke (follows path of blue planet orbit)
- Number of stars in the sky
