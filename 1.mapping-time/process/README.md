## Design sketches for three non-text clock faces

### Racing Dots
Design based on dots of different sizes (signifying different time periods) moving across the screen at different speed from left to right.

### Blocks
Three different rectangles arranged in thirds (signifying different time periods). Each rectangle has a block of color that moves from one edge to ther other (different direction for each rectangle). The color fades as the time period progresses.

### Bullseye
Three growing concentric circles. Each circle grows gradually between two sizes from the start of its time period (i.e. zero seconds) to its largest point (i.e. 60 seconds). The maximum size of one circle is the minimum size of the next largest circle.
