# Process
## Design sketches for three non-text clock faces

### Racing Dots
Design based on dots of different sizes (signifying different time periods) moving across the screen at different speed from left to right.

### Blocks
Three different rectangles arranged in thirds (signifying different time periods). Each rectangle has a block of color that moves from one edge to ther other (different direction for each rectangle). The color fades as the time period progresses.

### Bullseye
Three growing concentric circles. Each circle grows gradually between two sizes from the start of its time period (i.e. zero seconds) to its largest point (i.e. 60 seconds). The maximum size of one circle is the minimum size of the next largest circle.

### Pie Chart Calendar
- 12 Small circles represeting each month
- Each colour related to the season
- Each circle is a pie chart representing the progress through the month
- Larger cirlcles are days formatted in weekly rows
- Grey cirlces are days not within the month
- While circles are days in the month not yetr completed
- Colored cirlces (based on the month color) are completed days
- Pie chart for progress through each day

## Orbital Calendar
- One rotation of the blue cirlcearound the yellow cirlce = 1 year
- One rotation of the grey circle around the blue circle = 1 day
- Change in colour of the blue circle to a dark grey = change from day and night

## Abstract Calendar
- Each edge will grow from the center of the image to the edge.
- Each edge represets a different value.
- Top = Day
- Right = Week
- Bottom = Month
- Left = Year

## Hybrid - Concentric
- Each ring represents a month
- Incomplete months are greyed out / low opacity
- Complete months are full color
- Color Scheme represents seasons. Colors will fade from one month colour to the next
- Current month occupies two rows (double the width of any other month)
- Current months colours will be hues of the month / season color.
- The inner row is split into quarters, with growing progress sections represeting second, minute, hour, and day.
- The outer larger progress bar is not split and represents progress throuygh the month.
- When the month completes it is displayed as one complete single ring (as the all of the inner rings).

## Hybrid - Every Second
- Each color represents a different time period, in order from top left to bottom right
- Pink : seconds
- Blue : Minites
- Organge: Hours
- Purple : Days of the week
- Green : Days through the year
- Dark Green : Start of Each new Month
- Each filled circle is a completed time period.

## Hybrid ([Chosen Design](https://github.com/neil-oliver/dvia-2019/tree/master/1.mapping-time/final_through_space_and_time)) - Through Space and Time
Design adapted from the [Orbital Calendar](https://github.com/neil-oliver/dvia-2019/tree/master/1.mapping-time/date_2_orbit) with changes to add time objects as well as make the orbits correct to the orbit of the sun, earth and moon. Details found [here](https://github.com/neil-oliver/dvia-2019/tree/master/1.mapping-time/final_through_space_and_time).
