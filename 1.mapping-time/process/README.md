## Design sketches for three non-text clock faces

### Racing Dots
Design based on dots of different sizes (signifying different time periods) moving across the screen at different speed from left to right.

### Blocks
Three different rectangles arranged in thirds (signifying different time periods). Each rectangle has a block of color that moves from one edge to ther other (different direction for each rectangle). The color fades as the time period progresses.

### Bullseye
Three growing concentric circles. Each circle grows gradually between two sizes from the start of its time period (i.e. zero seconds) to its largest point (i.e. 60 seconds). The maximum size of one circle is the minimum size of the next largest circle.

### Pie Chart Calendar
- 12 Small circles represeting each month
- Each colour related to the season
- Each circle is a pie chart representing the progress through the month
- Larger cirlcles are days formatted in weekly rows
- Grey cirlces are days not within the month
- While circles are days in the month not yetr completed
- Colored cirlces (based on the month color) are completed days
- Pie chart for progress through each day

## Orbital Calendar
- One rotation of the blue cirlcearound the yellow cirlce = 1 year
- One rotation of the grey circle around the blue circle = 1 day
- Change in colour of the blue circle to a dark grey = change from day and night
