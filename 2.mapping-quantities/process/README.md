## Process

## Digital Designs
### Country Test Comparison Over Time
A side by side comparision of each country and the amount of tests (bubble size) in each year.
![]()

### Height / Magnitude Per Country Over Time
A timeline of every test throughout history. Color coded for country. Size of the bubble represents the magnitude of the explosion. Height (aobve and below the axis) represents the height or depth (underground or underwater) of the test.

### Quite The Alarm Clock - When do the majority of tests happen?
At what time of the day do tests take place? At 3AM apparently! Color coded for country, the distance from the center is how many explosions happened in that time period (hour).

## Sketches
### The Rise and Fall of Nuclear Testing
A comparion for each country on how much they increased or decreased their testing **based on the previous year**. A fall in the line would represent a slower increase, a fall below the axis would be less testing than the previous year. Color coded per country. 
![]()

### Above Ground, Underground or Underwater
Three stacked (independent) bar charts mapping the tests that happen above ground, underground or underwater. X Axis is time (year), Y is amount of tests per year.

### A Race To The Sun - The Rise of the SuperPowers
#### Uses External Data Source - [Space Launches](https://github.com/TheEconomist/graphic-detail-data/tree/master/data/2018-10-20_space-launches)
A focused comparison between two superpowers, the USA and the USSR, between the years of 1945 (when the nuclear testing started) and 1969 (when we landed on the moon). X axis is time, Y axis is number of tests.
