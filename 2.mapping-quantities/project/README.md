# Final Project
## Does the most powerful army make the most powerful country?
*In 1963 J. David Singer created the Composite Index of National Capability (CINP) as part of the [Correlates of War project](http://www.correlatesofwar.org). The index uses 6 values to give a statistical value of state power beyond GDP. The index is still today considered to be still among the best-known and most accepted methods for measuring national capabilities [[source](https://web.archive.org/web/20110626235023/http://www.giga-hamburg.de/english/content/rpn/strategy/pdf/power_index.pdf)].*

This visualization focusing on 5 countries (USSR includes Russia after 1991), comparing the CINP value against miilitary measures includes spend, size, nuclear testing and international conflicts.
