Exploring museum collections online: Some background reading,Major-Studio,8/29/19,Neil,"What is the role of a curator in a presentation of a digital collection? Whitelaw states that we should ‘Provide rich overviews of collections, not entry points. Don’t dictate user journeys. Don’t narrow their experience’ but is the most open-ended option always the best as a starting point for discovery?
 
Do you think that information from the user’s online behaviors and self-discovery of items through ‘generous interfaces’ could be used to inform the curation of the displayed collection within the museum? What changes might be made in the museum apart from simply looking at the most popular items visited on the museum website?
 
The article states that they are considering using additional data sources such as Wikidata, Dbpedia, image recognition and optical character recognition to gather more data on items with sparse catalogue record data. While the information on these websites is hopefully reliable, does its inclusion on a museum website give an unjustified weight to its reliability? For example, most people would take information from a museum website at fact, however they may question is validity from a wiki page. This reliability of this information may be further reduced due to its AI based collection method. How could this be overcome without manual checking?",https://lab.sciencemuseum.org.uk/exploring-museum-collections-online-some-background-reading-da5a332fa2f8,TRUE,Reading ,,,,
"Hadley Wickham, Tidy Data",Major-Studio,9/5/19,Neil ,"Wickham’s viewpoint only discussed the tidying of tabular data and states that ‘Messy data is any other arrangement of the data.’ Does this mean that object based structures such as JSON and MongoDB would be considered messy?

What is the payoff between an increased storage size of a tidy dataset that has been ‘melted’ vs the increased processing time of a messy dataset? Should we store information in its most space efficient form and then tidy before analysis?",https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10/v59i10.pdf,TRUE,Reading ,,,,
Lev Man,Major-Studio,9/12/19,Neil ,"The differentiation between an online museum collection and a digital library collection was very interesting in relation to being able to represent a complete sample. Do the efforts of The MET to create Open Access go far enough in bringing a wide breadth of cultural and historical information to the masses, or should the initiative have been created in collaboration with other museums from the beginning? Is the MET’s collection (isolated from other collection data) still a valuable resource?

Manovich discusses the limitations of social media data in relation to the lack of complete representation for both location and demographics. In what way does the location, ownership and target audience of the MET affect their collection and therefore the data we are obtaining for our visualizations? Do we need to consider this when stating what we believe we are displaying?",http://manovich.net/content/04-projects/102-cultural-data/cultural_data_article.pdf,TRUE,Reading ,,,,
Using the Visualization Software Evaluation Rubric to explore six freely available visualization applications,Major-Studio,9/19/19,Neil,"I felt that there were several inconsistencies in the evaluations. Why was Tableau Creator not included in the ‘full version’ evaluation? It is discussed as additional software at a ‘moderate’ cost ($70 a month!) while Plot.ly’s $33 a month is given a zero score and described as ‘often out of the realm of comfort for individuals’. Another example is VisualizeFree scores a 2 for data harvesting no additional information on why it would not have scored 3 (as Tableau did).

The inclusion of a total score and presenting comparisons such as average score take into consideration each of the evaluation areas equally. Is this the best method? Is login requirements as important to an overall score compared to ease of use or ability to manipulate? Would a ranking system for each evaluation area have been a better approach?",https://doi.org/10.7191/jeslib.2018.1122,TRUE,Reading ,,,,
"Lupi, G",Major-Studio,9/26/19,Neil,"Lupi states “Dense and unconventional data visualizations promote slowness — a particularly poignant goal to set in our era of ever- shortening attention spans.” Are the more conventional data visualizations that we see a result of short attention spans, or a need for faster analysis? In a world that seems to be moving more towards ‘headlines only’ (skip the process), is part of our job to do part of this analysis and discard what may not be relevant to the questions being asked?

 “Business intelligence tools and dataviz tools for marketers have led many to believe that the ideal way to make sense of information is to load data into a tool, pick from among a list of suggested out-of-the-box charts, and get the job done in a couple of clicks.” Do we always need a complex and personalized visualization for every time we need to visualize data? Is there no place for tools such as the basic graphs in Excel?",https://medium.com/@giorgialupi/data-humanism-the-revolution-will-be-visualized-31486a30dbfb,TRUE,Reading ,,,,
Selecting semantically-resonant colors for data visualization,Major-Studio,10/3/19,Neil,"How do we approach finding the correct balance between semantic meaning, color discriminability and inference of value (or order)? Is there a place for artistic input in this process?

Felton states that PhotoViz is a collection of photography that “demonstrate patterns, reveal the invisible and tell more descriptive stories”. Are there other examples outside of traditional visualizations and Photoviz that achieve this same goal?",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/cgf.12127,TRUE,Reading ,,,,
Using Typography to Expand the Design Space of Data Visualization,Major-Studio,10/10/19,Neil,"Brath discusses the rare use of font weights and italics in visualizations, however the use of these elements seems prominent in current map designs including map based abstractions such as the NYC subway map. Are there other elements that are commonly used in cartography that could be more widely implemented in data visualization?

The table of preattentive visual attributes was fascinating and matched what Kiran Healey discussed in Data Visualization for Social Science regarding the issues in identifying shapes in large datasets. Position was one attribute that stood out as not being a preattentive attribute, which would suggest that scatterplots are not preattentively perceived. How much do you think we have to consider these in our visualization choices?",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405872616300107?via%3Dihub,TRUE,Reading ,,,,
Death of Interactive infographics,Major-Studio,10/10/19,Neil,"In defense of interactive infographics reminded me of a discussion point at Nadieh Bremer recent NYC talk. She discussed interactivity as an additional service that she offered, something that was added on top of a visualization design, but definitely something that was an option (based on budget). Should all visualizations work without interaction or are there still opportunities to create visualizations where interaction is essential?

I found the comments about interactions potentially adding transparency and trust in the data to be really interesting and something I think is of huge importance, particularly when we see lots of examples of visualizations that give misleading snapshots. Are there additional methods we should be trying to employ to increase the transparency and trust in our data?",https://medium.com/@dominikus/the-end-of-interactive-visualizations-52c585dcafcb,TRUE,Reading ,,,,
"Heer, Jeffrey & George G. Robertson (2007), Animated Transitions in Statistical Data Graphs. ",Major-Studio,10/31/19,Neil,"The results of both the object tracking and estimating changing values tests show that animations and transitions can have a positive impact on the speed and accuracy of a users understanding of the changes in data. When should speed and ease of tracking take preference over the ability to have an ongoing comparison through using multiple static visualizations? 

Mike Bostock’s object constantly example clearly helps to show the rearrangement and entering / exiting of elements into the visualization. I personally feel that the adaptive X axis makes it hard to compare the comparative growth or reduction for each city, only clearly seeing their ranking change. Is scaling the axis’ when adapting content always the preferred approach or are the examples or scenarios where a fixed axis is more appropriate?",https://cdn.mprog.nl/dataviz/excerpts/w5/Heer_Animated_Transitions.pdf,TRUE,reading ,,,,
"Giorgia Lupi, The Architecture of a Data Visualization",Major-Studio,11/7/19,Neil,"Lupi justifies her artistic approach by stating that it is not intended for decision making processes or scientific purposes. However if her artistic embellishments are adding an element of memorability to the data, is there space for artistic approaches to be used in data visualization for scientific / business purposes?

Both articles touch on how the aesthetic elements of a visualization can have an emotional impact on the reader. Is obtaining this emotional response something that we should be aiming for (or purposefully considering), or is it not always relevant?",https://medium.com/accurat-studio/the-architecture-of-a-data-visualization-470b807799b4,TRUE,Reading,,,,
"Jessica Hagy, Visualization Indexed",Major-Studio,11/14/19,Neil,"The closing sections of Hagy’s article reminded me of Lupi’s comments from last weeks reading regarding how visualizations can both be beautiful to look at but also be intellectually compelling. Should we always aim to please both the emotional and intellectual sides of the reader, or are there examples where we are only aiming at one of these aspects?

Reactive Data visualizations discusses the more complex side of data visualizations, their implementation and the need for model based approaches. While a model based approach can go far to expand the possibilities of an interactive visualization, the single threaded nature of javascript still limits more complex processing tasks. Do you think the increased popularity in more complex interactive visualizations will pull designers away from javascript into other development environments such as python and server side processing?",http://blogs.ischool.berkeley.edu/i247s12/files/2012/01/Visualization.Indexed.pdf,TRUE,Reading,,,,
Immersed in Unfolding Complex Systems,Major-Studio,11/21/19,Neil,"The AR article by Dominikus Baur makes augmented reality feel like it’s just at our fingertips. Even if AR becomes more readily available in the near future, will this technology be accessible for all? What are the equity implications for this new field? 

In the Immersed in Unfolding and Complex Systems reading, the authors discuss their role in visualizing data for scientists and the interplay between artistic computational form vs. scientific accuracy. At the end of the article they note “the distinction among artists, scientists, and engineers begins to disappear”. Though I like the idea of interdisciplinary work, can we really merge the role of scientist/visualizer when working with such complex information?",https://www.mat.ucsb.edu/Publications/putnam_OReilly2010.pdf,TRUE,Reading ,,,,
